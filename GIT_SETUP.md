# Git Setup Status

✅ Repository initialized
✅ All files committed

**Next Step**: Add GitHub remote

## What You Need To Do

1. Create a GitHub repository (if you haven't):
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it (e.g., "project-spector")
   - Don't initialize with README
   
2. Copy your repository URL, it will look like:
   - `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git`
   - or `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git`

3. Provide the URL and I'll complete the push

## Already Have a Repo?

Just provide the URL and I'll push immediately.
