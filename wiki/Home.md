# Welcome to Project Spector Wiki

## What is Project Spector?

Project Spector is an AI-driven NPC simulation framework that implements Warren Spector's "One City Block" vision - a game world where depth replaces breadth. Instead of a vast open world, players explore a single city block where they can enter every building, open every drawer, and have meaningful interactions with every NPC.
